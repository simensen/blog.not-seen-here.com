<img src="/images/2010-02-11_21.23.46.jpg" alt="Urban Construction " /><p>Unfortunately I got to West Seattle too late to check out the <a href="http://speakandbherd.blogspot.com/2010/01/artswest-presents-urban-constructions.html">Urban Construction</a> show at ArtsWest in West Seattle. I was able to get a view of some of <a href="http://www.johnosgood.com/">John Osgood&#39;s</a> pieces, though.<p /> <br /></p>
