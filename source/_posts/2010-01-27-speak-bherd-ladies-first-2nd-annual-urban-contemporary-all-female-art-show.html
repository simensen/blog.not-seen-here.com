Feb 12 from 6-10pm</strong></p><p><br />What better month than February to highlight a ladies only urban contemporary art show. This is our 2nd Annual show and feel that perhaps we should just declare the month of February as a celebration of Fabulously Fresh Females Artists! The artists that we are presenting next month are each incredibly productive, talented and highly motivated women who have shown their work on a national and some on an international level. If you attend any popular local art festival or craft show, you are sure to see Soule, Soopajdelux, Michelle Smith-Lewis and Coco Howard among the mix of entreprenurial talent.</p><p><br /></p><p><span style="font-size: 85%;">Here's a closer look at one of Soule's pieces that will be featured at the show...</span></p><p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_W-CqBoHjzhs/S1osBxhmaQI/AAAAAAAACgQ/jkaXzvppD8Q/s1600-h/Soule_minstencilcan.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_W-CqBoHjzhs/S1osBxhmaQI/AAAAAAAACgQ/jkaXzvppD8Q/s320/Soule_minstencilcan.jpg" border="0" height="320" alt="" width="230" style="HEIGHT: 320px; CURSOR: hand;" /></a></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-size: 85%;"></span> </p><p><span style="font-size: 85%;">And here a closer look at Coco Howard's needlepoint wall hanging...</span></p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_W-CqBoHjzhs/S1or3iVr9pI/AAAAAAAACgI/--Ye1zxWQ0g/s1600-h/Howard_showpiece2.JPG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_W-CqBoHjzhs/S1or3iVr9pI/AAAAAAAACgI/--Ye1zxWQ0g/s320/Howard_showpiece2.JPG" border="0" height="320" alt="" width="313" style="HEIGHT: 320px; CURSOR: hand;" /></a><p></p><p>More sneak peeks will be revealed as we get closer to the opening, so please stay tuned!</p><p><a href="http://www.bherdstudios.com/">http://www.bherdstudios.com/</a><br />Gallery Hours: Wed - Fri from 12-6pm and by appointment
