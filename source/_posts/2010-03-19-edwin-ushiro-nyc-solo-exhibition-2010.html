<p>I am seriously loving Edwin's work. I only own <a href="http://suite100gallery.com/artwork/641">one very small piece</a> but it is definitely a favorite in my collection. The work from his upcoming solo show is amazing.</p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<p />PROJECT ROOM:<p />Edwin Ushiro, At Night, Lights Fell and Loved Ones Returned Home<p />RECEPTION:<p /><span><span>Wednesday, March 24th, 6 to 8 pm</span></span><p />EXHIBITION:<p /><span><span>March 24 to April 17 2010</span></span><p />Sloan Fine Art is pleased to present At Night, Lights Fell and Loved Ones Returned Home, by Edwin Ushiro in the project room.<p />The content of Edwin Ushiro&rsquo;s work is as richly layered as the works themselves. Influenced by the memories and folklore of his childhood in<span>&nbsp;</span><span><span>Hawaii</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span>and with nods to Japanese Anime, Ushiro creates a new mythology populated with modern characters and contemporary references. With At Night, Lights Fell and Loved Ones Returned Home, Ushiro utilizes his technique of layering paint, ink, graphite, varnish and iron transfers on vinyl&nbsp; sheets to create romantic, luminescent works that focus specifically on the mystery and histories held by abandoned and forgotten places.<p />Edwin Ushiro earned his BFA with honors from<span>&nbsp;</span><span><span>Art Center College of Design</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span>in Pasadena. Since he began exhibiting in 2006, his works have been shown at galleries and museums worldwide including LeBasse Projects in<span>&nbsp;</span><span><span>Culver City</span></span>, the Giant Robot Biennale at the Japanese American National Museum in<span>&nbsp;</span><span><span>Los Angeles</span></span>, the Insa Art Center inSeoul, and the Museum of Kyoto, Japan. Ushiro currently resides in Culver City, California.<p />Sloan Fine Art is located at 128<span>&nbsp;</span><span><span>Rivington Street</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span>on the Lower East Side of<span>&nbsp;</span><span><span>New York City</span></span>.
