<p><a href="http://www.flatcolor.com/art.html">FlatColor gallery</a> has recently updated their website to make it easier to browse the art they have available for sale (including some of the work from my solo show "Light in the Darkness"...).</p>
<p>Go check it out, you may find a little something you can't live without...or maybe just some cool stuff to look at.</p>
