<p>Flatcolor Gallery welcomes seven amazing local and national female artists in February. Participating artists include Kelly Vivanco, Melissa Moss, Kinoko, Mia Christopher, Lesley Reppeteaux, Jen Corace, and Karin Yamagiwa Madan.</p>
<p>Primarily focused on the whimsical and exploring themes of nature and the fantastic, each artist will exhibit several pieces showcasing their unique artistic style. From rosy-cheeked girls and frolicking squirrels,  to rainbow colored Cyber-Shaman; this exhibition features a diverse collection of eye-catching work.</p>
<p><strong>Opening reception: February 4th, 2010 5-9PM</strong><br /> The exhibition will run through February 27th, 2010.</p>
<p>About the Artists</p>
<p><strong>Kelly Vivanco</strong><br /> "Kelly Vivanco was born and raised in front of a sketchpad and a box of colors in Southern California where she later received her BFA with honors from LCAD.  Kelly enjoys setting whimsy to work in many mediums and pulls inspiration from the natural and imagined world, vintage photographs, children&Otilde;s literature and the oddness of her dreams.</p>
<p>In 2004 Kelly opened a space in the Distinction building in Escondido, California, and currently maintains a working studio there. She has shown solo and in group shows at the California Center for the Arts Museum, Distinction, Thinkspace, SURU, Gallery 1988, Subtext, Rotofugi Gallery, Halogen Gallery, Art Basel and Orange County Center for Contemporary Arts. Her work is held in collections across the U.S. and abroad." <br /> <a href="http://www.kellyvivanco.com/" target="_blank">http://www.kellyvivanco.com/</a></p>
<p><strong>Melissa Moss</strong><br /> Born and raised in Cincinnati, Melissa Moss, who now lives in Asheville, NC, has a background in color psychology and is well versed in the meanings of colors and their subtle shades and tones. Painting on wood with acrylic, Melissa combines colors in an arresting way, creating a tinted world that is very much her own invention.</p>
<p>Melissa's paintings of delicate trees and otherworldly flowers may depict adorable creatures being devoured or pretty pink flowers attacking a tree. Tiny details such as drops of blood or imperiled creatures are not always evident at first glance. Sometimes sinister, this is the subterranean landscape that lies beneath a child's fairy tale or a Saturday morning cartoon. <br /> <a href="http://www.melissamossart.com/" target="_blank">http://www.melissamossart.com/</a></p>
<p><strong>Kinoko</strong><br /> Kinoko is cyber shaman with the eye and the attitude for insouciant illustrative works. Her emotional work is often popping with a fluo palette. Optimistic themes of technology for a tribal society reveal clues to a connected rich spiritual future. Reaching back to ancient societies, Kinoko fantasizes post future lore. Visual influences including the East Village movement of New York 1980&Otilde;s, Super Flat art of Japan, and the New Paradigm Shift of 2012, are blended with studies of native cultures and new primitivism by Kinoko inspiring a quest towards a balanced, aware and positive relationship with both technology and biology.</p>
<p>Kinoko is an illustrator, painter, screen printer, DJ and cyclist. She is originally from Philadelphia where she attended the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. She has lived in Japan and in the US, and currently, resides in Cascadia, Pacific Northwest. Kinoko has been in group shows in Europe, Canada, Japan and the U.S. She is always looking for more art challenges to feed her drawing addiction. <br /> <a href="http://www.kinokogallery.com/" target="_blank">http://www.kinokogallery.com/</a></p>
<p><strong>Mia Christoper</strong><br /> Mia Christopher is a multi-disciplinary artist currently based out of San Francisco, CA. She has most recently been studying painting and drawing at California College of the Arts, but much of her past work has been based in printmaking and textiles. Her work is a construction of characters and events, often made up of deceptively simple elements with rich underlying messages of emotion, balance and breakdowns in communication. This current series of monotypes is reflective of the efforts made by some in attempts to create personal connections. <br /> <a href="http://www.miachristopher.com/" target="_blank">http://www.miachristopher.com/</a></p>
<p><strong>Lesley Reppeteaux</strong><br /> Lesley Reppeteaux is a storyteller who is deeply affected by the marriage of art and literature. Within her work you'll find long limbed beauties with dangerous claws, stories of sea swept sirens, and creatures from the deep - a bewitching gathering of all the cloven-hoofed vixens that prance in her head. <br /> <a href="http://www.reppeteaux.com" target="_blank">http://www.reppeteaux.com</a></p>
<p><strong>Jen Corace</strong><br /> Jen Corace was born and raised in the suburbs of southern New Jersey. She attended the Rhode Island School of Design from 1992-1996 and graduated with a BFA in Illustration. She balances her time between Seattle &amp; Rhode Island where she lives &amp; works on children's books &amp; her fine artwork. <br /> <a href="http://www.jencorace.com/" target="_blank">http://www.jencorace.com/</a></p>
<p><strong>Karin Yamagiwa Madan</strong><br /> Karin Yamagiwa Madan is a maker of "things and stuff". Her 'some-of-a-kind' artworks of Stumpytown were developed from the memories of childhood and the traits of friends and loved ones. She loves the color purple and hates getting out of bed. <br /> <a href="http://www.stumpytown.com/" target="_blank">http://www.stumpytown.com/</a></p>

<p>This looks like it will be a great show. It has been several months since I have made it out to a Flatcolor opening but hopefully that will change in February.</p>
